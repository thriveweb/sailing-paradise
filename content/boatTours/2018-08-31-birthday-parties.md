  From young kids parties all the way through to 80th's and beyond, we can
  create a memorable and fun birthday party that you and your guest will
  remember for years to come.


  The smooth and stable nature of the catamaran means our boats are suitable for
  all ages and abilities.


  No matter what style of birthday party you wish to create, we can help.
  Whether you are looking for a relaxing day on the water with a BBQ and a few
  beers. A kids birthday party with a beach stopover, sand castles, cakes and
  clowns. Or a boat party with cocktails, inflatable flamingos and awesome tunes
  bring it on!   


  Our guests tell us that spending a day (or evening) on the water was one of
  their best ever Gold Coast birthday party ideas!

   At Sailing In Paradise, we are continually striving to create the best experience possible for our guests.

  We understand that you want your special day to be memorable, fun, relaxing
  and stress free and that is exactly what we specialise in.


  From the moment you send through an enquiry all the way through to the follow
  up email with your free souvenir photos after your cruise, we pride ourselves
  on our professional yet friendly and laid back attitude.

        Expect the unexpected. Every day is different when you have your Gold
        Coast birthday party on board Sailing In Paradise but one thing is for
        sure... you're in for one hell of a good time.


        Some things we love include:


        Sailing, beach stopovers, inflatables, stand up paddleboards,
        snorkeling, sunbathing. All included free of charge.


        Some things are almost mandatory:


        Singing Happy Birthday to you, cake, embarassing speeches, presents.
      title: What to expect
    - dropdownContent: |-
        Keep it simple.

        Swimmers and beach towels.

        Food and drink (unless you want us to organise the catering for you).

        Smiles and good vibes.

        We'll provide the rest.
      title: What to Bring
    - dropdownContent: |-
        Please remember:

        No red wine, No sparklers, No drunken idiots and No bad juju.
      title: Considerations
    - dropdownContent: >-
        We have done a lot of research to find the best Gold Coast caterers and
        are happy to organise this on your behalf, or you are more than welcome
        to BYO.


        We do have a bbq on board which you are free to use however as you will
        need to cook this yourself we find that this can detract from your
        enjoyment on the day therefore we recommend this only if you have booked
        the boat for 4 hours or more. But the choice is yours.


        Again we find the best idea is to Keep it Simple.


        Fingerfoods are the go and the latest craze is grazing boards or
        platters. These can look sensational as a centrepiece for the large
        timber tables we have on board and your guests are free to pick away at
        their convenience.


        You can see some samples of the caterers we have used in the past on our
        social media pages.


        If you think you're up to the challenge to create your own platter, feel
        free to take some inspo from these also or check out pinterest.
      title: Catered or BYO
    - dropdownContent: >-
        Arrive in style with a stretch Hummer limousine.


        Add some exciting watersports. Jetboating and Parasailing can be
        arranged and they can pick you up off the boat.


        Have cocktails in one of the rooftop bars or hit the clubs in Surfers or
        Broadbeach after your cruise, or dine in some of Australia's best
        restaurants located right here on the Gold Coast. Ask us for
        recommendations.


        Indulge in a relaxing day spa or treat yourself to some retail therapy.


        Take in the sights from above with a Seaplane, Helicopter flight or Hot
        Air Balloon.


        Have a hit at the Goldies newest attraction TopGolf.


        Gather the troops for some Indoor karting at Slideways GoKarts or battle
        it out with a paintball tournament.


        The list goes on and on.

        Q. What happens if it's raining?


        A. Check out our wet weather policy HERE.


        Q. I sometimes get seasick, is there waves?


        A. The boat is very smooth and stable and we operate in the calm
        Broadwater so there are not many waves apart from the odd boat wash. Our
        skilled captains have ways of keeping the boat very smooth so you don't
        spill your drink and you definitely won't get seasick.


        Q. Do I need to bring sunscreen, inflatables, towels, camera, water or
        music?


        A. Most things are provided however you will need to byo towel. One of
        our friendly staff will let you know what is included when you make your
        initial enquiry.


        Q. How do I book?


        A. Fill out an enquiry form HERE and you will quickly get all the info
        you need including availability, pricing, inclusions etc. Then it is
        simply a matter of paying your deposit to secure your preferred date.
        But don't dawdle as we quickly book out and we don't want you to be
        dissapointed.


        Q. Why should we choose you over another operator?


        A. This list is endless. Check out our reviews, check out our socials,
        speak to someone who has been with us before (you would be surprised,
        you will probably know someone who has been with us?), and we pride
        ourselves on the fact that our guests keep coming back (some have been
        with us as many as 8 times). We go out of our way to create the best
        experience possible and are constantly updating, re-inventing,
        reinvesting and reviewing. We're not happy until you're happy and we
        want you to come back again and again.
