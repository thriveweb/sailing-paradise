  ## gold coast birthday boat party


  If you are looking for the perfect birthday party venue on the Gold Coast then
  look no further. Sailing In Paradise can cater for groups of up to 30 people
  on our signature sailing catamaran the 'Spirit of Gwonda' or combine both our
  beautiful catamarans to suit up to 50 people, or we can arrange a raft up
  party with 4 catamarans for up to 90 people. 


  The sailing catamarans are smooth and stable and very open plan making them
  perfect for entertaining.


  You can choose to BYO everything or we can arrange all the catering for you.


  Each boat is equipped with everything you would expect from a luxury catamaran
  including superb sound system with free access to premium Spotify, stainless
  steel barbecue, large eskies with ice and beautiful bathrooms.


  And those 'little extras' we offer are endless.  Please keep reading for the
  complete rundown...

  From young kids parties all the way through to 80th's and beyond, we can
  create a memorable and fun birthday party that you and your guest will
  remember for years to come.


  The smooth and stable nature of the catamaran means the boat is suitable for
  all ages and abilities.


  No matter what style of birthday party you wish to create, we can help.
  Whether you are looking for a relaxing day on the water with some yummy food
  and a few drinks. A kids birthday party with a beach stopover, sand castles,
  cakes and clowns. Or a raucous birthday party with loud music, inflatables and
  all the trimmings, we are here for you. 


  We have some great Gold Coast birthday party ideas also.

   At Sailing In Paradise, we are continually striving to create the best experience possible for our guests.

  We understand that you want your special day to be memorable, fun, relaxing
  and stress free and that is exactly what we specialise in.


  From the moment you send through an enquiry all the way through to the follow
  up email with your free souvenir photo’s after your cruise, we pride ourselves
  on our professional yet friendly and laid back attitude.

      title: What to expect
    - dropdownContent: |-
        Keep it simple.

        Swimmers and beach towels.

        Food and drink (unless you want us to organise the catering for you).

        Smiles and good vibes.
      title: What to Bring
    - dropdownContent: |-
        Please remember:

        No red wine, No sparklers, No drunken idiots and No bad juju.
      title: Considerations
    - dropdownContent: >-
        We have done a lot of research to find the best Gold Coast caterers and
        can organise this on your behalf or you are more than welcome to BYO.


        We do have a bbq on board which you are free to use however as you will
        need to cook this yourself we find that this can detract from your
        enjoyment on the day therefore we recommend this only if you have booked
        the boat for 4 hours or more. But the choice is yours.


        Again we find the best idea is to Keep it Simple.


        Fingerfoods are the go and the latest craze is grazing boards or
        platters. These can look sensational as a centrepiece for the large
        timber tables we have on board and your guests are free to pick away at
        their convenience.
