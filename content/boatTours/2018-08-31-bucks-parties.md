  ## gold coast  bucks party


  "Get the Buck outa here."


  Want to get out on the water and have some fun?


  We can help organise a bachelor party to remember.


  This won't be your usual tacky bucks boat party though, we like to add a touch
  of style to everything we do.


  Gather the boys and cruise the beautiful Gold Coast waterways on a luxury
  sailing catamaran, listening to some cool tunes. Pull up on a white sandy
  beach on a deserted island for a hit of beach cricket or footy and have a
  gourmet barbecue with some ice cold beers. Sound good?


  OK. Yes you can be served that ice cold beer by a lovely, scantily clad
  waitress if you must.
