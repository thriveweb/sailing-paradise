  ## gold coast  bucks party


  "Get the Buck outa here."


  Want to get out on the water and have some fun?


  We can help organise a bachelor party to remember.


  This won't be your usual tacky bucks boat party though, we like to add a touch
  of style to everything we do.


  Gather the boys and cruise the beautiful Gold Coast waterways on a luxury
  sailing catamaran, listening to some cool tunes. Pull up on a white sandy
  beach on a deserted island for a hit of beach cricket or footy and have a
  gourmet barbecue with some ice cold beers. Sound good?

      "We used this wonderful company to start my sisters bucks celebrations and
      the girls haven’t stopped talking about it since. It was a beautiful day
      out on a beautiful boat with an amazing crew! Will definitely be in
      contact again with Steve if I can think of any other reason to go for a
      sail. Thank you so much for your time and not laughing at our dance moves
