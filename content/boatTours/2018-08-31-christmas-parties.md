  If your Gold Coast Christmas Party has fallen into the 'get me out of here
  this is soooooo dull' category once too often, we are here to help fix
  that!   


  Aboard your own private catamaran our crew are on hand to help make your
  Christmas Party perfect for your group.  


  ## Christmas Party Ideas


  Got your own ideas?   Tell us what floats your boat and we'll do our best to
  make it happen.  Some options include;


  * A relaxed sunset cruise with canapes and champagne, 

  * A day on the water with swimming, Island activities and delicious BBQ lunch 

  * or even a high octane team building day with sailing challenges and
  jetboating?


  These are just a few of the Gold Coast Christmas Party ideas available with
  Sailing in Paradise.   The options are endless and our friendly team are on
  hand to help you plan 'your Christmas Party your way'.  


  We have looked after all sorts of industry clients from fitness studios and
  restaurants to banks and legal firms (and everything in between).   There is
  something about spending time on the water that brings people (of all ages and
  backgrounds) together and we would love to help you put on a Christmas Party
  your whole team will talk about for years to come!




  ## Christmas Party Planners, we are here to help...    


  You are busy, we totally get it!   That's why we offer a fuss-free service.  
  From the moment you enquire and receive our Christmas Party info pack we are
  here to make your life easier.   


  If you want to lock in your party now and forget about until the day that is
  totally fine, we can take care of food, drinks and activities and we will even
  provide your team with photos of your cruise afterwards, it's all part of the
  service.  




  ## No sea-sickness guaranteed


  We just had to put this in as we hear it so often...    If your boss got sick
  once on a Carribbean Cruise, or Julie from accounts feels a bit queasy
  whenever she gets in the bath, tell them not to worry.   We have taken out
  thousands of guests (including many with concerns for sea-sickness) and it is
  always fine.   Why?  A few reasons;


  1. We sail in calm protected waters (we do not go offshore)

  2. We operate a wide, stable catamaran (not the same side to side rocking of
  single hull vessels)

  3. You will be having too much fun! 




  So enquire now and we can help to plan your best Christmas Party ever in 2019!

      "We used this wonderful company to start my sisters Christmas celebrations
      and the girls haven’t stopped talking about it since. It was a beautiful
      day out on a beautiful boat with an amazing crew! Will definitely be in
      contact again with Steve if I can think of any other reason to go for a
      sail. Thank you so much for your time and not laughing at our dance moves
      and pop star singing voices!"
