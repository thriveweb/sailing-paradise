  ## Christmas Party Ideas


  Got your own ideas?   Tell us what floats your boat and we'll do our best to
  make it happen.  Some options include;


  * A relaxed sunset cruise with canapes and champagne,

  * A day on the water with swimming, Island activities, and delicious BBQ lunch
  and icy cold beers,

  * or even a high octane team building day with sailing challenges and water
  sports?


  These are just a few of the Gold Coast Christmas Party ideas available with
  Sailing in Paradise.   The options are endless and our friendly team are on
  hand to help you plan 'your Christmas Party your way'.  


  We have looked after all sorts of industry clients from fitness studios and
  uber-cool restaurants to banks and legal firms (and everything in between).  
  There is something about spending time on the water that brings people (of all
  ages and backgrounds) together and we would love to put on a Christmas Party
  your whole team will talk about for years to come!


  ## Christmas Party Planners, we are here to help...


  OK you have found your perfect Christmas Party, yay!   What now?  Time for a
  mojito…(ahem, well we need to set the scene for what's to come).


  But in all seriousness, you are busy, we totally get it!   That's why we offer
  a fuss-free service.   From the moment you enquire and receive our Christmas
  Party info pack we are here to make your life easier.   


  If you want to book in your party now and forget about until the day that is
  totally fine.  We can take care of food, drinks and activities and we will
  even provide your team with photos of your cruise afterwards.  It's all part
  of the service.  So you can actually relax and enjoy the party!

  ## The Christmas Party Boats


  What do our customers love about our catamarans?   Well, time and time again
  they tell us they are the ideal venue for parties!    And work Christmas
  Parties are no exception.

        Our 2 luxurious 10.5 metre resort style sailing catamarans mean we can
        now cater for larger groups of up to 50 (or even 90 with additional
        vessels) people – The Spirit Of Gwonda can accommodate up to 30 guests
        (plus 2 crew) and our new boat the 1000XL has a capacity of 20 (plus 2
        crew).
      title: 1-90 Guest Capacity

        The layout of our boats are ideal for a Christmas party venue and make
        entertaining large groups a delight.   The spacious interior of the boat
        offers plentiful seating, a large central table, a permanent hard roof
        and 360 degree visibility (making it suitable for all weather
        conditions).


        On-board you will find a small marine BBQ, large eskys (ice supplied),
        Fusion Marine sound system with speakers inside and out, bluetooth
        connectivity and premium Spotify provided and marine toilet.


        The front of the boat is extremely popular with guests, offering a
        trampoline-style area perfect for lazing in the sun whilst listening to
        the sounds of your favourite Christmas songs streaming through our
        Fusion sound system.

        The front boarding ladder and shallow draft make the vessel perfect for
        pulling up onto a beach at Wavebreak Island, South Stradbroke Island or
        one of the many golden sandy shores in the Gold Coast broadwater. Your
        skipper will pick the best spot for you on the day!


        Fancy floating around on an inflatable flamingo, or maybe giving Stand
        Up Paddle Boarding a go?   Perhaps you are feeling energetic and want to
        bring the team together with a hit of beach cricket or volleyball.   We
        carry all of these activities on-board for your use free of charge.

        If your boss got sick once on a Caribbean Cruise, or Carol from accounts
        feels a bit queasy whenever she gets in the bath, please tell them not
        to worry.    Why?  A few reasons;


        1. We sail in calm protected waters (we do not go offshore)

        2. We operate a wide, stable catamaran (not the same side to side
        rocking of single hull vessels) meaning you won’t spill a drop of your
        Christmas cocktail and you won’t be feeling queasy.

        3. You will be having too much fun!


        PS...  Carol should probably see a doctor, this is not normal :-)

        We work with some excellent caterers and can offer a range of Christmas,
        brunch, lunch or dinner options from budget through to premium.   If you
        would prefer to BYO that is completely fine too!


        We offer a full bar service including competitively priced drinks
        packages.  Alternatively you can choose to BYO drinks.

        We love hoisting the sails and switching off the motors. One of the few
        true sailing experiences you will find on the coast and the only
        commercial sailing boat capable of taking 30 people.
