  Work Christmas Parties...the one day (or night) of the year that has the
  potential to bring the team together in a way that no team meeting or
  corporate event can do, but sadly often falls flat.     If your Gold Coast
  Christmas Party has fallen into the 'get me out of here this is soooooo dull'
  category once too often, we are here to help fix that!   


  Aboard your own private catamaran you call the shots and our crew are on hand
  to help make your Christmas Party perfect for your group.  


  So what floats your boat? 


  * A relaxed sunset cruise with canapes and champagne, 

  * A day on the water with swimming, Island activities and delicious BBQ lunch 

  * or even a high octane team building day with sailing challenges and
  jetboating?


  These are just a few of the Gold Coast Christmas Party ideas available with
  Sailing in Paradise.   The options are endless and our friendly team are on
  hand to help you plan 'your Christmas Party your way'.  


  We have looked after all sorts of industry clients from fitness studios and
  restaurants to banks and legal firms (and everything in between) and pride
  ourselves on making sure our guests enjoy the experience not matter their age,
  background or interests.   There is something about spending time on the water
  that brings people together and we would love to help you put on a Christmas
  Party your team will talk about for years to come!


  ## Christmas Party Planners, we are here to help...    


  You are busy, we totally get it!   That's why we offer a fuss-free service.  
  From the moment you enquire and receive our Christmas Party info the plan is
  that we are here to make your life easier.   


  So if you want to lock in your party now and forget about until the day that
  is totally fine, we can take care of food, drinks and activities and we will
  even provide your team with photos of your cruise afterwards, it's all part of
  the service.

      "We used this wonderful company to start my sisters Christmas celebrations
      and the girls haven’t stopped talking about it since. It was a beautiful
      day out on a beautiful boat with an amazing crew! Will definitely be in
      contact again with Steve if I can think of any other reason to go for a
      sail. Thank you so much for your time and not laughing at our dance moves
      and pop star singing voices!"
