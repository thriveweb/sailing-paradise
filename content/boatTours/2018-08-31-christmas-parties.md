contentColumnTitle: Not your average office Christmas Party!
contentColumn: "If your Gold Coast Christmas Party has fallen into the 'get me out of here this is soooooo dull' category once too often, we are here to help fix that!   \n\nAboard your own private catamaran our crew are on hand to help make your Christmas Party perfect for your group.  \n\n## Christmas Party Ideas\n\nGot your own ideas?   Tell us what floats your boat and we'll do our best to make it happen.  Some options include;\n\n* A relaxed sunset cruise with canapes and champagne, \n* A day on the water with swimming, Island activities and delicious BBQ lunch \n* or even a high octane team building day with sailing challenges and jetboating?\n\nThese are just a few of the Gold Coast Christmas Party ideas available with Sailing in Paradise.   The options are endless and our friendly team are on hand to help you plan 'your Christmas Party your way'.  \n\nWe have looked after all sorts of industry clients from fitness studios and restaurants to banks and legal firms (and everything in between).   There is something about spending time on the water that brings people (of all ages and backgrounds) together and we would love to put on a Christmas Party your whole team will talk about for years to come!\n\n\n\n## Christmas Party Planners, we are here to help...    \n\nYou are busy, we totally get it!   That's why we offer a fuss-free service.   From the moment you enquire and receive our Christmas Party info pack we are here to make your life easier.   \n\nIf you want to lock in your party now and forget about until the day that is totally fine, we can take care of food, drinks and activities and we will even provide your team with photos of your cruise afterwards, it's all part of the service.  \n\n\n\n## The Christmas Party Boats\n\nWhat do our customers love about our boats?   Well, time and time again they tell us they are the ideal venue for parties!    And corporate Christmas Parties are no exception.\r\n\n\r\n\n From 1 to 50 guests (we can also source additional vessels for larger raft up parties) – our 2 luxurious 10.5 metre resort style sailing catamarans mean we can now cater for larger groups of up to 50 (or even 90 with additional vessels) people – The Spirit Of Gwonda can accommodate up to 30 guests (plus 2 crew) and our new boat the 1000XL has a capacity of 20 (plus 2 crew).\r\n\n\r\n\n Open Plan Layout – great for Company Christmas Parties. The layout of our boats are ideal for a Christmas party venue and make entertaining large groups a delight.   The spacious interior of the boat offers plentiful seating, a large central table, a permanent hard roof and 360 degree visibility (making it suitable for all weather conditions).\r\n\n\r\n\n 360 degree views from all areas – the front of the boat is extremely popular with guests, offering a trampoline-style area perfect for lazing in the sun whilst listening to the sounds of your favourite Christmas songs streaming through our Fusion sound system.\r\n\n\r\n\n Pull up directly on the beach – the front boarding ladder and shallow draft make the vessel perfect for pulling up onto a beach at Wavebreak Island, South Stradbroke Island or one of the many golden sandy shores in the Gold Coast broadwater. Your skipper will pick the best spot for you on the day!\r\n\n\r\n\n Smooth and Stable catamaran = no sea-sickness. The boat is extremely smooth and stable meaning you won’t spill a drop of your Christmas cocktail and you won’t be feeling queasy.\r\n\n\r\n\n Fully Catered or BYO – we work with some of the Gold Coast’s best caterers and can offer a range of Christmas lunch or dinner options from budget through to premium.   If you would prefer to BYO that is completely fine too!\r\n\n\r\n\n Fully licensed or BYO – we offer a full bar service including competitively priced drinks packages.  Alternatively you can choose to BYO drinks.\r\n\n\r\n\n Free use of beach activities – fancy floating around on an inflatable flamingo, or maybe giving Stand Up Paddle Boarding a go?   Perhaps you are feeling energetic and want to bring the team together with a hit of beach cricket or volleyball.   We carry all of these activities on-board for your use free of charge.\r\n\n\r\n\n Excellent on-board facilities – on-board you will find a small marine BBQ, large eskys (ice supplied), Fusion Marine sound system with speakers inside and out, bluetooth connectivity and premium Spotify provided and marine toilet.\r\n\n\r\n\n Sailing – we love hoisting the sails and switching off the motors. One of the few true sailing experiences you will find on the coast and the only commercial sailing boat capable of taking 30 people.\n\n\n\n## \n\n\n\n\n\nSo enquire now and we can help to plan your best Christmas Party ever in 2019!"

        We just had to put this in as we hear it so often...    If your boss got
        sick once on a Carribbean Cruise, or Julie from accounts feels a bit
        queasy whenever she gets in the bath, tell them not to worry.   We have
        taken out thousands of guests (including many with concerns for
        sea-sickness) and it is always fine.   Why?  A few reasons;


        1. We sail in calm protected waters (we do not go offshore)

        2. We operate a wide, stable catamaran (not the same side to side
        rocking of single hull vessels)

        3. You will be having too much fun!

      "We used this wonderful company to start my sisters Christmas celebrations
      and the girls haven’t stopped talking about it since. It was a beautiful
      day out on a beautiful boat with an amazing crew! Will definitely be in
      contact again with Steve if I can think of any other reason to go for a
      sail. Thank you so much for your time and not laughing at our dance moves
      and pop star singing voices!"
