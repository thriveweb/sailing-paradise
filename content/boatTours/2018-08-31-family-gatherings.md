  ## gold coast Family yacht charters


  There is something about spending time with family on the water that spans
  generations.  When you charter a boat with Sailing in Paradise we aim to
  provide a special experience the whole family will enjoy.    Loved by the
  grandparents just as much as the kids (and everybody in between) our 2
  beautiful sailing catamarans are comfortable, spacious and stable making them
  suitable for all ages and most abilities.    Whether it be for special family
  birthday, a reunion, family holiday or if you are a Gold Coast local wanting
  to show off our beautiful part of the world to visiting family members we
  invite you to enjoy a private yacht charter during the day or at sunset and
  create some new family memories to treasure for years to come.

We can arrange rods and bait for you and the kids to have a go at catching a fish if you wish, simply let us know when booking.  \r\n\nFor daytime cruises, the whole family can enjoy a stop at Wave Break Island, where our vessels unique beach landing capabilities come into their own!     With a secret ladder on the foredeck its easy to hop on and off.   There’s buckets and spades for the little ones to play and make sandcastles, and plenty of calm water for everyone to jump in for a swim or safely wade about in the shallows. The young and young at heart will love snorkelling the Islands diving site to discover a variety of colourful fish, we also have SUPing and inflatable toys for the family to enjoy. If you’re feeling energetic and want to bring the family together you can have a game of beach volleyball or cricket right there on the island! We have something for everyone!\r\n\nWe make chartering a boat easy and tailored to your family’s needs, so we give you the option of choosing where you would like to go and what you would like to do within your chartered time.

      title: What's included;
    - dropdownContent: "**Where do your boats depart from?**\r\n\nOur boats are berthed at D9 and D10 at Marina Mirage. Please see the 'contact us' page on our website www.sailinginparadise.com.au for further details and a map. Marina Mirage is about 10 mins from Surfers and 15 mins from Broadbeach.\r\n\n\r\n\n**Where can I park?**\r\n\nThere is plentiful free parking underneath the Marina Mirage Shopping Centre which you are permitted to use.\r\n\n\r\n\n**What about other transport options?**\r\n\nThere are lots of ways to get to the boat! The most popular (and cost effective/convenient) if often via Maxi Taxis.\r\n\n\r\n\n**Are your charters suitable for children?**\n\nAbsolutely!   We love having kids on board and our crew will often try and include them in the sailing and driving the boat.  We also carry a range of beach games suitable for kids including buckets and spades for the littlest family members.  The wide and spacious deck area also make the boats wonderful for kids, of course you are always careful with children when it comes to being on the water but as boats go our catamarans would be some of the most family friendly around.  Please feel free to contact our team if you have any questions about which boat may be best for your family.  \n\n\n\n**Can I BYO food and drink?**\n\nYes if you would like to bring your own food and drinks on board that is completely fine.\r\n\n\r\n\n**I am short on time can you please help me out with catering/drinks?**\n\nYes, we also offer catering and drinks service for your convenience. Please request our full catering list as advance bookings are required. We offer a range of catering options from grazing boards, to tapas and private chefs.\r\n\n\r\n\n**Do you have Eskies on board?**\r\n\nYes we do and we also provide ice. The eskies are very large and can be used for food or drink.\r\n\n\r\n\n**Where can we go on our charter?**\r\n\nWe operate in the calm, protected waters of the Gold Coast Broadwater. Where to go very much depends on what you would like to do and how long your boat charter is for so please feel free to discuss this with our team. In a 3 hour charter during the day our guests usually love a swim stop at Wavebreak Island where you can enjoy the range of island activities on board. Your skipper can make recommendations on the day, if you don't wish to swim you could also go up and sail around the millionaires mansions at Sovereign Islands.\r\n\nIn the evening we usually recommend sailing north to watch the sunset and returning to the southern part of the Broadwater to see the city lights after dark which are just beautiful.\r\n\n\r\n\n**Will I get seasick?**\r\n\nNope. We operate in the calm, protected waters of the Gold Coast Broadwater. We do not go\r\n\noffshore (into the open ocean) so we do not experience large waves. Our catamarans are very stable, and do not have the same side to side rocking motion as experienced by single hull vessels so you won't get seasick :-).\r\n\n\r\n\n**What happens if it rains?**\r\n\nFirst of all remember...a little rain doesn't stop a great time on our boats especially in the warm Gold Coast endless summer... But do rest assured that we have a very generous wet weather policy as we want you to enjoy your time on board the boat, so if there is torrential rain or storms at the time you will be able to cancel or reschedule your cruise. Please see the full booking policy provided with your invoice for full details or contact our team."
