  ## gold coast Family yacht charters


  There is something about spending time with family on the water that spans
  generations.  When you charter a boat with Sailing in Paradise we aim to
  provide a special experience the whole family will enjoy.    Loved by the
  grandparents just as much as the kids (and everybody in between) our 2
  beautiful sailing catamarans are comfortable, spacious and stable making them
  suitable for all ages and most abilities.    Whether it be for special family
  birthday, a reunion, family holiday or if you are a Gold Coast local wanting
  to show off our beautiful part of the world to visiting family members we
  invite you to enjoy a private yacht charter during the day or at sunset and
  create some new family memories to treasure for years to come.

contentColumn: "Our luxury catamarans are family friendly and ideal for guests of all ages and abilities, and the wide and spacious deck area makes it ideal for everyone to get around and get some fresh ocean air. There is lots of space to park a pram if required, or just laze back and watch the world sail by. We like to encourage our guests (big or small) to have fun and participate in hoisting the sails and manning the helm!\r\n\nKeep your eyes peeled throughout the cruise as you very well may spot some marine and wildlife creatures on the picturesque Broadwater. Friendly and playful dolphins, soaring sea-eagles and wallabies on the shoreline are often to be seen while underway.   We can arrange rods and bait for you and the kids to have a go at catching a fish if you wish, simply let us know when booking.  \r\n\nFor daytime cruises, the whole family can enjoy a stop at Wave Break Island, where our vessels unique beach landing capabilities come into their own!     With a secret ladder on the foredeck its easy to hop on and off.   There’s buckets and spades for the little ones to play and make sandcastles, and plenty of calm water for everyone to jump in for a swim or safely wade about in the shallows. The young and young at heart will love snorkelling the Islands diving site to discover a variety of colourful fish, we also have SUPing and inflatable toys for the family to enjoy. If you’re feeling energetic and want to bring the family together you can have a game of beach volleyball or cricket right there on the island! We have something for everyone!\r\n\nWe make chartering a boat easy and tailored to your family’s needs, so we give you the option of choosing where you would like to go and what you would like to do within your chartered time. We can offer adventure and family friendly activities or rest and relaxation, the choice is yours! You can choose to BYO food and drinks or a fully catered charter for easy planning. We supply the eskies, ice, BBQ and BBQ tools free of charge.\r\n\nlso."
