  ## gold coast Hens party boat


  Hen's Parties are totally our thing!  We love them and, well,...they love
  us... (blush).   Its a mutual admiration kind of situation and we couldn't
  think of any place we'd rather be :-).     


  Any style, any vibe the choice is yours, we don't bring pre-prescribed ideas
  of what a hens party should be.  We simply bring beautiful, spacious (and
  totally photogenic) boats with a super-fun, professional crew to help you host
  the hen's party of your dreams.

contentColumnTitle: Plan your perfect hens party cruise
contentColumn: >-
  We have hosted thousands of happy Hens parties but no two have ever been
  alike.   So what will you party be?  A relaxed afternoon on the water with
  swimming and sunbaking, an elegant morning tea with mimosas or a wild hen's
  night party with all the hen's party trimmings?  The choice is totally yours
  and we are here to help with whatever you wish.    


  We are continually striving to create the best experience possible for our
  guests.  We understand that you want your special day to be memorable, fun,
  relaxing and stress free and that is exactly where we come in.


  From the moment you send through an enquiry all the way through to the follow
  up email with your free souvenir photos after your cruise, we pride ourselves
  on our professional yet friendly and laid back attitude.


  ## the perfect hen's party boats


  With 2 beautiful sailing catamarans available for charter we can accommodate
  groups of up to 20 or 30 guests.    Click here for a tour of our boats.  


  The large trampoline-style fore-decks are perfect for lazing in the sunshine
  or dancing, while we sail the calm, clear waters of the Gold Coast. The ample
  undercover space makes the vessels perfect for those seeking shade. Facilities
  are plentiful to ensure you have everything on hand to enjoy a perfect day!

  ## All the hens party extras


  We have a great novelty floating inflatables available. Kick back on one of
  our supersized flamingos or swans, laze on a giant slice of watermelon or pull
  up a pineapple.


  We also offer a range of free activities including stand up paddleboards,
  beach cricket, snorkelling, beach volleyball or frisbees.


  Be sure to dress for the occasion, as we always take photos on the day to
  capture all those precious moments so you can take lots of great memories
  home.  Practically all of the photos you will see on [our Instagam page
  ](https://www.instagram.com/sailinginparadisegoldcoast/)are taken by our crew
  on board actual charters so that's a sample of what you can expect.  


  We are confident that a Gold Coast henâ€™s party with Sailing In Paradise, is an
  experience your group will be talking about for years to come!

        Don't expect a cookie-cutter hens party!   We realise that every hen is

        that and will adapt our service on the day to suit your vibe whatever
        that may be.

      title: What to Bring
    - dropdownContent: >-
        So you've decided you want a boat party...now time to plan it!   


        You can take whatever approach you wish towards planning your party and
        we've got your back.  We understand that life gets busy (especially when
        there is a wedding to help plan) so if you would like us to take care of
        things like catering, drinks and cheeky butlers so you can just turn up
        and enjoy then we will take the helm and sort everything out on your
        behalf!  


        If you have heaps of ideas of your own and want to customise or theme
        your party let us know what you've got planned and we are happy to give
        advice and ideas on how it may work.  


        Here are a few extra hen's party ideas;


        ## Pick a theme


        We love a themed hen's party!   Some of our faves have included nautical
        (sailors hats, stripes), mermaids, all white (classic and always looks
        so chic) and tropical (just perfect for a boat/island party)


        If you are looking at our BYO option why not carry the theme into your
        food and drink.  We also welcome themed decorations (there are a few
        guidelines around this so please do check in with us first).   
        Generally we recommend the table is a great place to start with theming
        since these are centrally located on both boats and provide a nice focal
        point.  


        ## Plan some hen's party games


        We have seen it all on board the boat from;


        * how well do you know the groom games

        * cardboard cut outs of the groom ha ha

        * toilet paper wedding dress creations 

        * tug of war on the beach

        * Bridal Bingo

        * Hen's Party Dares

        * Plus some very cheeky games involving our cheeky butlers ha ha




        ## Talking of cheeky butlers...


        If you are looking for the perfect ice breaker guaranteed to make the
        bride smile and her nan giggle we can't recommend these guys enough.  
        Wearing just an apron, bow tie and a smile our butlers are not just
        pretty faces.  With a personality guaranteed to get the party started
        your personal butler will serve drinks, play games and keep your guests
        entertained all while making the perfect hen's party eye candy.

    - dropdownContent: "**Where do your boats depart from?**\r\n\nOur boats are berthed at D9 and D10 at Marina Mirage. Please see the 'contact us' page on our website\r www.sailinginparadise.com.au for further details and a map. Marina Mirage is about 10 mins from Surfers and 15 mins\r from Broadbeach.\r\n\n**Where can I park?**\r\n\nThere is plentiful free parking underneath the Marina Mirage Shopping Centre which you are permitted to use.\r\n\n**What about other transport options?**\r\n\nThere are lots of ways to get to the boat! The most popular (and cost effective/convenient) if often via\r Maxi Taxis. We can also assist in organizing bus, hummer or limo transfers if you are after more of an experience.\n\n**Can I BYO?**\r\n\nYes if you would like to bring your own food and drinks on board that is completely fine.\r\n\n**I am short on time can you please help me out with catering/drinks?**\r\n\nYes, we also offer catering and drinks service for your convenience. Please request our full catering list as advance\r bookings are required. We offer a range of catering options from grazing boards, to tapas and private chefs.\r\n\n**Do you have Eskies on board?**\r\n\nYes we do and we also provide ice. The eskies are very large and can be used for food or drink.\n\n**Where can we go on our charter?**\r\n\nWe operate in the calm, protected waters of the Gold Coast Broadwater. Where to go very much depends on what you\r would like to do and how long your boat charter is for so please feel free to discuss this with our team.   In a 3 hour charter during the day our guests usually love a swim stop at Wavebreak Island where you can enjoy the range of island activities on board.   Your skipper can make recommendations on the day, if you don't wish to swim you could also go\r up and sail around the millionaires mansions at Sovereign Islands.   \n\nIn the evening we usually recommend sailing north to watch the sunset and returning to the southern part of the Broadwater to see the city lights after dark which are just beautiful.  \n\n**Will I get seasick?**  \n\nNope.   We operate in the calm, protected waters of the Gold Coast Broadwater. We do not go\r\n\noffshore (into the open ocean) so we do not experience large waves. Our catamarans are very stable, and do\r not have the same side to side rocking motion as experienced by single hull vessels so you won't get seasick or spill your drink either :-).  \n\n**What happens if it rains?**\n\nFirst of all remember...a little rain doesn't stop a great party on our boats ha ha...   But do rest assured that we have a very generous wet weather policy as we want you to enjoy your time on board the boat, so if there is torrential rain or storms at the time you will be able to cancel or reschedule your cruise.  Please see the full booking policy provided with your invoice for full details or contact our team."
