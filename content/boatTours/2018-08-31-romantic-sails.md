contentColumn: "Choose from our daytime or evening sailing options to experience the Gold Coast in a different light.  During the day, our boats are equipped for beach landings so you may wish to stop at an Island for swimming, SUP'ing and snorkelling.  As dusk falls the sunset over the Gold Coast hinterland mountains is a delight to view from the water and after dark the Surfers Skyline puts on a spectacular light show for our return to Marina Mirage.  \r\n\nOur beautiful Seawind 1000XL is the ideal vessel for couples due to its intimate design, and offers the relaxation of sailing in complete comfort.   The trampoline-style foredeck is a favourite spot for snuggling and offers an immersive sailing experience with 360 degree views of the Gold Coast’s stunning waterways.  It is also the ideal spot for spying the friendly bottle-nose dolphins who frequently ride the bow waves of our catamarans, so close you can almost touch...\r\n\nRead more about our boats here\r\n\n\rWe would love to chat with you via phone or email any time and start planning your charter which can be fully customised to your wishes. \r\n\n\n\nLooking to join other guests on board?  Consider a ticketed cruise…"

    - dropdownContent: "We operate in the calm, protected waters of the Gold Coast Broadwater. Where to go very much depends on what you would like to do and how long your boat charter is for so please feel free to discuss this with our team. In a 3 hour charter during the day our guests usually love a swim stop at Wavebreak Island where you can enjoy the range of island activities on board. Your skipper can make recommendations on the day, if you don't wish to swim you could also go up and sail around the millionaires mansions at Sovereign Islands in this time.\r  With a longer charter you may also have time for a snorkel stop or to visit South Stradbroke Island or spend a little longer chilling at Wavebreak and enjoy a relaxing lunch.  \n\nIn the evening we usually recommend sailing north to watch the sunset and returning to the southern part of the Broadwater to see the city lights after dark which are just beautiful."

      title: Do you offer special packages?
    - dropdownContent: "**Where do your boats depart from?**\r\n\nOur boats are berthed at D9 and D10 at Marina Mirage. Please see the 'contact us' page on our website www.sailinginparadise.com.au for further details and a map. Marina Mirage is about 10 mins from Surfers and 15 mins from Broadbeach.\r\n\n\r\n\n**Where can I park?**\r\n\nThere is plentiful free parking underneath the Marina Mirage Shopping Centre which you are permitted to use.\r\n\n\r\n\n**What about other transport options?**\r\n\nThere are lots of ways to get to the boat! The most popular (and cost effective/convenient) if often via Maxi Taxis.\r\n\n\r\n\n**Are your charters suitable for children?**\r\n\nAbsolutely! We love having kids on board and our crew will often try and include them in the sailing and driving the boat. We also carry a range of beach games suitable for kids including buckets and spades for the littlest family members. The wide and spacious deck area also make the boats wonderful for kids, of course you are always careful with children when it comes to being on the water but as boats go our catamarans would be some of the most family friendly around. Please feel free to contact our team if you have any questions about which boat may be best for your family.\r\n\n\r\n\n**Can I BYO food and drink?**\r\n\nYes if you would like to bring your own food and drinks on board that is completely fine.\r\n\n\r\n\n**I am short on time can you please help me out with catering/drinks?**\r\n\nYes, we also offer catering and drinks service for your convenience. Please request our full catering list as advance bookings are required. We offer a range of catering options from grazing boards, to tapas and private chefs.\r\n\n\r\n\n**Do you have Eskies on board?**\r\n\nYes we do and we also provide ice. The eskies are very large and can be used for food or drink.\r\n\n\r\n\n**Will I get seasick?**\r\n\nNope. We operate in the calm, protected waters of the Gold Coast Broadwater. We do not go offshore (into the open ocean) so we do not experience large waves. Our catamarans are very stable, and do not have the same side to side rocking motion as experienced by single hull vessels so you won't get seasick :-).\r\n\n\r\n\n**What happens if it rains?**\r\n\nFirst of all remember...a little rain doesn't stop a great time on our boats especially in the warm Gold Coast endless summer... But do rest assured that we have a very generous wet weather policy as we want you to enjoy your time on board the boat, so if there is torrential rain or storms at the time you will be able to cancel or reschedule your cruise. Please see the full booking policy provided with your invoice for full details or contact our team."
