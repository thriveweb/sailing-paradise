contentColumn: "The beauty of a private charter is that the boat is yours to use as you wish and you call the shots…  So if you fancy dropping anchor for a swim we can make it happen, if you would prefer to spend more time sailing that’s also fine. \r\n\nYou can choose from our delicious catering menu and drinks packages, or you are welcome to BYO food and drinks. We supply the eskies, ice, BBQ and BBQ tools free of charge. You can even take your pick of music on our private charters as we have Premium Spotify on board. You might want to show us your dance moves or create a relaxing atmosphere and chill to some peaceful tunes. \r\n\nWe strive to create the best experience possible for our guests and are always delighted when they come back to say we gave them the exact experience they were hoping for! We don’t just take you for a generic sightseeing cruise, we like to make it more about a unique experience that you and your guests will remember for years to come."

Wave Break Island is a little slice of paradise here on the Gold Coast and a must see, especially if you’re in holiday mode!    Our boats are equipped to pull up right on the beach, so you can hop on and off as you please. Take advantage of our range of beach activities and use the SUP’s or snorkel at the dive site and see a variety of small colourful fish. If you’re feeling energetic and want to bring your group together you can have a game of volleyball or cricket right there on the sand! \n\nYou’re going to see lots of interesting things while out on the Broadwater with us, so be sure to keep an eye out for friendly bottle-nose dolphins, stingrays, turtles, wallabies and soaring sea-eagles!   You can catch up on those rays while lounging out on the foredeck as we can sail up to Sovereign Islands to see the mansions of the rich and famous. \n\nWe have rods and bait on board so you can have a go at dropping a line in, you might even catch a fish!\r\n\nFancy trying your hand at sailing?   No problem, let our friendly crew know and they will have you hoisting the sails and manning the helm in no time.   Just want to chill and enjoy a few drinks and  maybe take a quick swim, this is totally fine too.  We also carry a range of fun activities on board the boat for your use.  \r\n\nOur cruises are fun and suitable for all ages."

    - dropdownContent: "**Where do your boats depart from?**\r\n\nOur boats are berthed at D9 and D10 at Marina Mirage. Please see the 'contact us' page on our website www.sailinginparadise.com.au for further details and a map. Marina Mirage is about 10 mins from Surfers and 15 mins from Broadbeach.\r\n\n\r****\n\n**Where can I park?**\r\n\nThere is plentiful free parking underneath the Marina Mirage Shopping Centre which you are permitted to use.\r\n\n\r****\n\n**What about other transport options?**\r\n\nThere are lots of ways to get to the boat! The most popular (and cost effective/convenient) if often via Maxi Taxis. \n\n\r****\n\n**Can I BYO food and drink?**\r\n\nYes if you would like to bring your own food and drinks on board that is completely fine.\r\n\n\r****\n\n**I am short on time can you please help me out with catering/drinks?**\r\n\nYes, we also offer catering and drinks service for your convenience. Please request our full catering list as advance bookings are required. We offer a range of catering options from grazing boards, to tapas and private chefs.\r\n\n\r****\n\n**Do you have Eskies on board?**\r\n\nYes we do and we also provide ice. The eskies are very large and can be used for food or drink.\r\n\n\r****\n\n**Where can we go on our charter?**\r\n\nWe operate in the calm, protected waters of the Gold Coast Broadwater. Where to go very much depends on what you would like to do and how long your boat charter is for so please feel free to discuss this with our team. In a 3 hour charter during the day our guests usually love a swim stop at Wavebreak Island where you can enjoy the range of island activities on board. Your skipper can make recommendations on the day, if you don't wish to swim you could also go up and sail around the millionaires mansions at Sovereign Islands.\r\n\nIn the evening we usually recommend sailing north to watch the sunset and returning to the southern part of the Broadwater to see the city lights after dark which are just beautiful.\r\n\n\r\n\n**Will I get seasick?**\r\n\nNope. We operate in the calm, protected waters of the Gold Coast Broadwater. We do not go\r\n\noffshore (into the open ocean) so we do not experience large waves. Our catamarans are very stable, and do not have the same side to side rocking motion as experienced by single hull vessels so you won't get seasick :-).\r\n\n\r****\n\n**What happens if it rains?**\r\n\nFirst of all remember...a little rain doesn't stop a great time on our boats especially in the warm Gold Coast endless summer... But do rest assured that we have a very generous wet weather policy as we want you to enjoy your time on board the boat, so if there is torrential rain or storms at the time you will be able to cancel or reschedule your cruise. Please see the full booking policy provided with your invoice for full details or contact our team."

    “Steve, Jessica and the team provided a fantastic experience for our family.
    The lunch was superb, Steve interacted with the kids to get them involved in
    getting the sails up which they loved. They took some amazing pictures which
    was all part of the service, not a chargeable extra. I can't recommend them
    enough.”
