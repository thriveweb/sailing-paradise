contentColumn: "The beauty of a private charter is that the boat is yours to use as you wish and you call the shots…  So if you fancy dropping anchor for a swim we can make it happen, if you would prefer to spend more time sailing that’s also fine. \r\n\nWe make chartering a boat easy and tailored to your needs, so we give you the option of choosing where you would like to go and what you would like to do within your chartered time.   You can choose from our delicious catering menu and drinks packages, or you are welcome to BYO food and drinks. We supply the eskies, ice, BBQ and BBQ tools free of charge. You can even take your pick of music on our private charters as we have Premium Spotify on board. You might want to show us your dance moves or create a relaxing atmosphere and chill to some peaceful tunes. \r\n\nWe strive to create the best experience possible for our guests and are always delighted when they come back to say we gave them the exact experience they were hoping for! We don’t just take you for a generic sightseeing cruise, we like to make it more about a unique experience that you and your guests will remember for years to come."
