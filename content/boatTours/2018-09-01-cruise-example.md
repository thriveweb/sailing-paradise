  The skipper will drop in some local knowledge for those who are interested.
  Guests can relax on the foredeck, inside the main cabin, or on a comfy bean
  bag.   This is a fun cruise suitable for the whole family!  Want to get
  involved in hoisting the sails and manning the helm?  Let us know and you’ll
  be one of the crew in no time.   The vessel ‘Spirit of Gwonda’ is often joined
  by wild bottle-nose dolphins and being nice and close to the water gets you
  nice and close to the dolphins if they decide to join your cruise.
