contentColumn: "Step aboard our beautiful Sailing Catamaran and enjoy a 3 hour cruise on the picturesque and calm Gold Coast Broadwater.     Take in the sights including impressive super yachts, Sea World, Palazzo Versace, South Stradbroke Island, Wavebreak Island and the Gold Coast Seaway.  \r\n\nVisit an isolated island beach only accessible by boat where you are invited to jump in for a swim and try our beach games (incl Volleyball, Stand Up Paddleboarding, Beach Cricket and Inflatables).   Or if you just want to chill on the beach (or our trampoline-style foredeck) that's totally fine, we'll play some cool tunes and serve up an icy cold drink from our on-board bar so you can relax and watch the world sail by in style.     But don't forget to keep your eyes peeled for the friendly bottlenose dolphins who regularly cruise past  \r\n\nThis is an laid-back cruise experience on a spacious sailing catamaran, with no more than 30 guests on board we love a social atmosphere and we can't wait to welcome you on board our beautiful boat!\r\n\nCruise includes light lunch and one complimentary bubbly, beer or soft drink."

      "We used this wonderful company to start my sisters Cruise celebrations
      and the girls haven’t stopped talking about it since. It was a beautiful
      day out on a beautiful boat with an amazing crew! Will definitely be in
      contact again with Steve if I can think of any other reason to go for a
      sail. Thank you so much for your time and not laughing at our dance moves
      and pop star singing voices!"
