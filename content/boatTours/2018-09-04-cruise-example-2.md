  Visit an isolated island beach only accessible by boat where you are invited
  to jump in for a swim and try our beach games (incl Volleyball, Stand Up
  Paddleboarding, Beach Cricket and Inflatables).   Or if you just want to chill
  on the beach (or our trampoline-style foredeck) that's totally fine, we'll
  play some cool tunes and serve up an icy cold drink from our on-board bar so
  you can relax and watch the world sail by in style.     But don't forget to
  keep your eyes peeled for the friendly bottlenose dolphins who regularly
  cruise past
