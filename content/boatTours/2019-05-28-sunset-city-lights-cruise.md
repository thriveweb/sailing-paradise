  ## Gold Coast Sunset Cruise


  Looking for the Gold Coast's best sunset views?   There is no better place to
  watch the sunset on the Gold Coast than on a boat!   No seriously...


  There is something so magical about a sunset over the water, but surrounded by
  it?  Well that's something else...   So come and join us for sundowners as the
  sun sets over the Gold Coast Mountains and casts a glow across the calm waters
  of the Gold Coast Broadwater.  


  We've got the champagne on ice!

  Join Sailing in Paradise on a cruise of the Gold Coast Broadwater aboard a
  beautiful Seawind 1050 Sailing Catamaran. With no more than 30 guests on board
  this sunset cruise is laid back, relaxed and fun. The skipper will drop in
  some local knowledge for those who are interested. Guests can relax on the
  foredeck, inside the main cabin, or on a comfy bean bag to the sounds of some
  very cool tunes and enjoy a few drinks. This is an intimate cruise experience
  on a spacious sailing catamaran with a social atmosphere. The vessel ‘Spirit
  of Gwonda’ is often joined by wild bottle-nose dolphins as they come in search
  of their evening meal and being nice and close to the water gets you nice and
  close to the dolphins if they decide to join your cruise. You will enjoy one
  complimentary glass of sparkling wine, beer or soft drink and nibbles and
  further drinks can be purchased on board at only $5 per drink.
