  â€œWe used Sailing in Paradise for a friends bridal shower. Steve was excellent
  with his communication in the lead up to our event and made sure we all felt
  very looked after. On the day of our sail all staff were extremely friendly
  and accommodating of all our requests. Needless to say the bride and all
  guests had an amazing time."
