  Lowan, China - “We made booking after reviewing others' comments and I am so
  glad I book with them, we chartered for 4 hours, we are a group of family with
  11 people, 3 small kids, 7 adults and 1 elderly and everyone enjoyed the trip
  so much. We had fishing, paddle boarding and kids playing on the beach. Steve
  and Phoebe made our entire outing very pleasant. They were both very nice with
  great hospitality. Everything was delivered as promised! Superb!” TripAdvisor

Our catamarans are ideal for families and suit young and elderly guests. There is huge deck space that makes it perfect for social gatherings. Lowan and his family organized an afternoon charter which was perfect for some family friendly beach activities at Wave Break Island, they even caught a fish which was the highlight!
