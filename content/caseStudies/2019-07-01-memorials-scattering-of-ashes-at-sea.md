  Elyce- “We booked a 2hr cruise to spread our mum’s ashes. The crew were
  wonderful and so respectful, and the boat was amazing, we didn’t want to get
  off. The crew also took photos throughout the day and it was such a nice
  touch. I highly recommend Sailing in Paradise, they were fantastic.”

We are always honoured to look after our clients who wish to have a memorial cruise for their loved ones. We took Elyce and her guests to a special place in the Broadwater to disperse their loved one’s ashes. At the end, we provided the GPS coordinates as a record to cherish forever. We do our best to assist in making the experience memorable in the best way possible.
