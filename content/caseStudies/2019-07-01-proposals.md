  Jessica, Australia – “Amazing scenery, very comfortable boat and really
  friendly professional staff, we had a fantastic time and the crew made it a
  very memorable occasion. We saw dolphins and other various marine life and the
  cruise back looking at the lights of the coast was spectacular. would
  defiantly recommend to anyone thinking of doing this.”

Mathew organised a special sunset proposal charter to pop the question to Jessica. At the perfect moment and to Jessica’s surprise, we pulled out the sail which said “will you marry me” while playing a special song of hers. The dolphins visiting made it even more perfect! We absolutely adore hosting proposals and have a 100% success rate!
