  Sam, Australia - “The sunset cruise was absolutely perfect to surprise my wife
  with a different kind of date while childless for the weekend. The SIP crew
  were very friendly and relaxed, making for an enjoyable experience. The
  knowledge of local scenery and precise timing of the cruise allowed for many
  brilliant photos with hardly any filters required. The dolphins coming out to
  play was the cherry on the cake! Will definitely be back when it’s time to
  forget life and chill out again!” Facebook review
