  Rich – “Accommodating and very friendly the entire time. Boat is very stable
  and even though I can experience motion sickness I didn’t on this boat. Nice
  photos too. The winter sunset is perfect and they offered blankets.  Dropbox
  3rd June 2018 (only sunset cruise)” can find this guy anywhere

If you are like Rich and can experience motion sickness, don’t worry! On our beautiful, smooth and stable catamarans you can sit back, relax and enjoy the best waterfront sunset views as we sail the calm and clear waters of the Gold Coast Broadwater. (You wont be needing the ginger!)
