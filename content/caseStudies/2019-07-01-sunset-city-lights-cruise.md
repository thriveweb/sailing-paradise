  Sandy, UK – “We did the 2-hour sunset cruise and very glad we did! The
  Catamaran was clean and spacious. The staff were friendly and provided us with
  a complimentary drink and nibbles, some stunning photographs and chill vibing
  tunes as we sailed into the sunset. A must do on the Gold Coast!” TripAdvisor
