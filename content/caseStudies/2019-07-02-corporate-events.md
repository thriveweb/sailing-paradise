  Tash, Sydney – “This sunset cruise comes highly recommended. Jess from Sailing
  in Paradise was excellent to deal with and very accommodating! The team were
  highly flexible and was able to set sail from the Sanctuary Cove rather than
  Surfers Paradise, very accommodating for the private group. Food, hospitality
  and cruise was FANTASTIC! Cannot recommend this highly enough especially for
  Corporate.10/10!” TripAdvisor

Sometimes planning corporate events can be overwhelming and stressful. Our team do as much as we can to take away any stress and look after you just like we did with Tash and her colleagues, which was a success. From the beginning with organizing the event/catering, right until the very end when you don’t want to get off the boat!
