  Lauren – “I highly recommend Sailing In Paradise! Had my sister’s hens party
  with them on Saturday - it was the best day ever!! The crew were fantastic and
  the planning process was so easy, they always got back to me in a timely
  manner. Do yourself a favour and book a cruise with Sailing In Paradise -

We absolutely love hosting hens party charters, and hens parties love us too! It’s kind of our speciality! Lauren organized an afternoon charter for her sisters hens party which was a stress-free and easy process!
