  Wyndham Vacations – “We had THE BEST time on the boat. The crew on board were
  fantastic, very cosy, relaxing, good food and drinks and picture-perfect
  weather and our pictures made the day a memorable one for all. Overall, it was
  a great experience and the best team build we had in ages. Thank you Jess very
  much and to the crew and chefs. We would highly recommend this with friends or
  work colleagues. It is a great way to relax, with food, good music and company
  of course.” TripAdvisor

Our private charters are ideal for planning corporate events with a difference!  We were delighted to host Wyndham’s corporate team build event with gourmet food from a private chef and beach activities! It was a relaxing and enjoyable day out with their colleagues, one they will remember for years to come!
