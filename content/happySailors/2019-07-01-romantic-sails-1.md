Taryn knew how much her partner Mark loves sailing and being out on the water, so she organized a private afternoon couples charter as a special gift for him. While we sailed around the beautiful Broadwater, the skipper included Mark in the sailing aspect and took the loved up couple to our favourite spot at Wave Break Island for relaxing time in the sun together and SUP’s.
