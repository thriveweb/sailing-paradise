There is something special about watching the sun setting over the water! Julieta is one of our many guests who have been greeted by our dolphin friends. They love riding the bow as we sail around the beautiful Broadwater. What a treat it is when they decide to join us! Keep an eye out for these majestic creatures, golden wallabies and sea-eagles on your next charter with us.
