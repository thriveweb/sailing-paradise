  Abbie – “I had the most amazing time celebrating my surprise hens sailing the
  Broadwater! Special thanks to Steve and Phoebe who made the whole experience
  so enjoyable and comfortable. Even in the rain we had a super awesome time,
  went swimming and used the paddle boards. Planning the next time I can get on
  there! Highly recommend!” Facebook review

Abbie and her guests didn’t let a little rain dampen their spirits! These ladies rocked up to Abbie’s hens party event ready to hit the water and keen to party! They danced with their flower crowns, jumped in for a swim at Wave Break Island, and booked out our cheeky Butler to help keep the drinks flowing and everyone entertained.
