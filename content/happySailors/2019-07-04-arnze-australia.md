  Arnze – “Had a fantastic time with Sailing in Paradise! A very friendly
  welcome from the captain and Chanelle! We went on a three-hour voyage, rules
  were explained quick and simple. Stopped at a quiet spot at wave break island,
  had our own food and relaxed with the paddle boards and inflatables!
  Afterwards, we continued round back to the Marina Mirage. The photographer had
  the photos out within the same day, had an amazing experience and made some
  great memories!” TripAdvisor

Arnze attended a private afternoon charter with us for a fun way to get friends together for a day they wont stop talking about! His group opted for BYO which is a great way to bring your favourite dishes or use the onboard BBQ. The choice is yours!
