  Chelsey – “I have sailed with Sailing in Paradise at both sunrise and sunset.
  Both times offered two very different experiences. The morning cruise was
  swimming and sun baking while the evening cruise was champagne and dancing. I
  highly recommend Sailing in Paradise for both experience and service.”
