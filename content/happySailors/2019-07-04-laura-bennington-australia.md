  Laura – “This was one of the best days I’ve had in a while. Wanted to do
  something a little different for my best friends hens party.  The whole team
  at sailing in paradise are so lovely and helpful. We docked because we ran out
  of alcohol (thank god we could dock for more hahah)  We also got to go for a
  swim on the floaties and sup boards! Music, dancing and some amazing views.
  Highly recommended! Thank you so much to the team for helping execute an
  amazing hens party!!” Tripadvisor
