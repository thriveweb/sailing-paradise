intro: "## our story\n\nWe sailed into the Gold Coast commercial boating scene back in 2011 and thanks to our loyal guests and amazing crew we are thrilled to have grown to where we are now, offering 2 beautiful sailing catamarans for private charters and cruises departing from Marina Mirage.   \r\n\nWith years of commercial boating experience including skippering charter boats, water taxis, jet boats and commercial jet skis.   \n\n> \"I wanted to offer an affordable luxury experience for locals and visitors to get out on the water and experience the Gold Coast’s beautiful waterways and islands.  But most of all HAVE FUN doing it! \"      \n>\n> _Owner - Steve Buckley_\n\nAfter falling in love with our beautiful signature vessel ‘Spirit of Gwonda’ (which remains one of the best catamarans on the water for social occasions) the dream became a reality and Sailing in Paradise was born.  \r\n\nIn response to guest demand, Gwonda’s little sister the Seawind 1000XL joined our fleet in 2018!\r\n\nBoth boats were carefully selected to offer the same spacious deck area, stable sailing and beach landing capabilities.  \r\n\n![](https://ucarecdn.com/91a59042-bf64-4505-9bad-e66124632b13/)"

        Sailing in Paradise was the brainchild of Steve.  Any of you who have
        sailed with Steve will probably recall his laid-back, likeable nature. 
        Taking a hands-on and active involvement in the business, if you are a
        regular at the Marina you will often find him working hard during the
        week to ensure the boats are in tip-top condition for our next charter
        guests.   He also skippers the boats regularly so rest assured you will
        be well looked after with Steve as part of your crew.  A self-confessed
        gadget geek and wannabe film-maker, Steve can often be found carting
        around a plethora of gadgets including drones, 360 cameras and go-pros
        but has yet to learn how to keep them out of the water…we have lost a
        few he he…

  captainIntro: "## Captains\n\nHi we are Steve and Jess and we own and manage Sailing in Paradise.  \n\nWe realise that chartering a boat is not something that you do every day.  Our aim is to make the entire experience as easy as possible, so that when you finally step aboard you can really just relax and enjoy the charter.  \r\n\nIn fact, guest happiness is our highest priority.    From your first enquiry, through to our optional catering/beverage packages and finally to our welcoming crew (who we are often told feel like part of the family after just a few short hours) we aim to exceed your expectations.   We encourage you to check out our social channels (Facebook, Instagram) and Guest Reviews (links) to really get a vibe for what we are about."
