  ## Welcome Aboard


  We invite you to meet our team and become part of the ever growing Sailing In
  Paradise family.


  We strongly believe that a huge part of our success, and the reason that we
  have so many repeat and loyal guests, is due to the fact that we care about
  what you feel.


  We want you to feel at home, we want you to feel our compassion, and we want
  you to feel the love.


  You are not just another customer to us, you are our guests and you are very
  special guests.


  Without **you** we wouldn't be here, loving our lives and living our dreams.




  ## Our Story.


  With a love of the water and a passion for sailing, Steve started Sailing In
  Paradise to share this love. 


  Having run a family hotel in a very competitive market in a suburb in inner
  city Sydney, Steve knows the importance of customer satisfaction, the value of
  good customer feedback, and the relevance of market trends.


  These 2 factors have contributed heavily to the successful operation of
  Sailing In Paradise from it's humble beginnings in 2011 to becoming one of the
  most successful Gold Coast charter boat companies that it is today.


  When Steve's wife Jessica joined the business in a full time role in 2016 the
  business really hit another level.


  Jess' background in Marketing and Event Management saw an injection of fresh
  ideas and concepts, and an unparalleled level of customer engagement. (If you
  have ever sent an enquiry through you will know what I'm talking about it.)


  As the business grew (and so did the family with the addition two boys) Jess
  and Steve realised that they had to expand the fleet and would need extra crew
  to join the family.


  It is always hard to 'hand over the reigns' when you have put in the hard
  yards and built up a successful business with a solid customer base but
  Sailing In Paradise have managed to draw on a mix of local knowledge and fun
  and professional personality traits to continue the tradition that Steve
  began.


  Steve and Jess have not left by any means and there presence is always there,
  from your first email enquiry through to your follow up correspondence after
  your cruise, and every step in between. If anything this has allowed them more
  time to concentrate on ensuring your experience is the best ever through other
  important avenues such as product research and development, guest interaction
  and event management and operations management. As their guest numbers grow,
  the Sailing In Paradise family is also expanding and evolving to meet, and
  exceed, the demands and expectations that are required to ensure that you
  receive the best experience possible. 


  There really is 'no reason needed' to get out on the water with these guys as
  they will make you feel like you are just having a day out on your own boat
  with some friends (and in the end it will probably cost a lot less $'s with
  zero stress).

        Steve is trying to concentrate more 'on the business' than in it, so you
        probably won't see him behind the wheel much any more but when he is
        there you'll be well looked after. He's a young 'nearly 50' but sorry
        ladies..married with 2 young kids.

        everything from jetski's, speedboats, jetboats, superyachts and sailing
        boats.


        He knows the local area like the back of his hand and "is quick with a
        joke or to light up your smoke and there's no place that he'd rather be"

    ## Captains


    Our highly skilled Captains have been hand picked to ensure that your
    experience with us is the best it can be.


    _You don't want a grumpy skipper or sleazy deck crew making you feel uneasy
    on your special day._


    Unlike some other boats where your skipper is hidden away up in a wheelhouse
    or on a flybridge, our skippers are right there, front and centre, in the
    thick of it. They have to be part of the party and have to have the
    personality to pull it off. But they also have a responsibility to ensure
    the safety of all guests at all times.


    It's a big call but we have found the best of the best to meet and smash the
    challenge...

    ## Our Crew

    personnell. They will go out of their way to ensure you have everything you
    need and want. They are friendly, courteous, professional, discrete and

    And they are damn good at photography.

    their photography skills and eye for detail and at the end of your charter
    you will receive several hundred special images capturing the most memorable
    moments of your experience.  Just another feature that sets us well above
