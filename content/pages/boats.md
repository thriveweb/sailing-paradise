      Our signature vessel, the ‘Spirit Of Gwonda’ is a Seawind 1050 Resort
      sailing catamaran which has been purpose built for entertaining and day
      cruises, and without having the need for bedrooms and kitchens allows for
      extra deck space to accommodate all your guests.


      The clever and unique design of these vessels ensures an open plan layout
      so all your guests can interact with each other.


      Of course we still offer all the luxuries you would expect including
      luxurious front trampoline sections for soaking up the sun, comfortable
      inside seating around a large central table, barbecue and modern bathroom
      facilities.


      Measuring 10.5m long by 6.5m wide, there is ample space for up to 30
      people (plus 2 crew), approx 60 square metres of deck space in fact.  You
      will be amazed at the room available inside this smooth and stable boat.
      The Spirit Of Gwonda is truly unique and the only one of it’s kind on the
      Gold Coast. In fact it is the only true ‘Sailing’ vessel that can hold up
      to 32 people in comfort.

      The latest addition to our fleet is a Seawind 1000XL. These catamarans are
      extremely popular in bareboat charter fleets as they have a great layout
      and all the extras you would expect from an overnight equipped vessel.


      The interior is set out with booth style seating around a large table with
      windows allowing for 360 degree viewing from all areas. There is extra
      seating in the targa area at the back and, as with our other vessel, there
      is ample area to laze around under the sun on the front trampoline area.


      The 1000XL is also equipped with a galley style kitchen, 2 large eskies, a
      marine bbq, and a modern bathroom with the added bonus of hot and cold
      showers both above and below deck.


      The 1000XL is perfect for groups of up to 20 people (plus 2 crew).
