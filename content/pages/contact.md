**HOW TO FIND THE BOAT AT THE MARINA**

We are conveniently located at Marina Mirage, 74 Seaworld Drive, Main Beach.  

When you reach Marina Mirage you will need to find the boat!!    The access to the wharf is located near the Ray White Marine Office.  Look for the big colourful signboard. **Please enter through the black gates to the left of the signboard that leads downwards to the long floating wharf. This is the D Arm of Marina Mirage.**

Please do not go down the pier with the big yellow arches as that is Mariners Cove and you will not be able to access the boat easily from this side.

If you can’t find us you can always call us and we will be happy to guide you.

**PARKING**

There is plentiful free parking which you are invited to use alongside and beneath the Marina Mirage Shopping Centre.
