**HOW TO FIND US**

When you reach the marina please take ramp on the right, through the black gates, that leads downwards to the long floating wharf.

Please do not go down the pier with the big yellow arches as that is Mariners Cove and you will not be able to access the boat from this side.

If you can’t find us you can always call us and we will be happy to guide you.

**PARKING**

There is plentiful free parking which you are invited to use alongside and beneath the Marina Mirage Shopping Centre.
