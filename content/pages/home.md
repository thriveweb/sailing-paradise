    We have 2 of the most beautiful and well maintained sailing catamarans
    available.


    These yachts are smooth and stable and  perfect for entertaining.


    Imagine yourself lazing in the sun on the trampoline style foredeck with a
    cocktail in hand or relaxing with friends in the undercover area, either way
    you will enjoy unobstructed views of the beautiful Gold Coast Broadwater and
    surrounds.


    Everything is taken care of - the coolest tunes playing through state of the
    art sound system with speakers inside and out, 2 large eskies stocked with
    ice, large central timber table for presenting your food, marine barbecue,
    inflatables, paddleboards and beach games, clean modern bathroom facilities,
    the list goes on and on.

    beyond, we go out of our way to ensure your expectations are not only met

    These guys are the best!! I would highly recommend Sailing in Paradise! We
    booked a 3 hour catamaran cruise for my hens night and had a fantastic
    experience. The crew (both in the lead up to the event and on the day) went
    above and beyond to make sure we had an amazing time! Thank you so much!!
